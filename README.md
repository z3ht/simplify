Repository for understanding organized complexity and chaos

I have not yet decided what exactly I want to do with this repo. I definitely want to create some chaotic visualizations. Beyond that I have no idea.

### Complexity Theory  
Complexity is the behaviour of a model whose components interact with eachother in multiple ways and follow logical rules. Usually, the term characterizes models which appear to culminate into a higer order of emergance greater than the sum of their parts. Defining complex systems is difficult due to the fact the definition is dependent on who is observing. However, in 1948 Warren Weaver published a paper "Science And Complexity" that breaks complex models into two groups: disorganized and organized. 'Disorganized Complexity' denotes systems which are broken into tiny parts whose behavior, as a whole, can be modeled using probability/statistics. The basis for this category is that, counterintuitively, it becomes easier to model the behavior of a system (lets say a game of billiards) as the number of objects (pool balls) increases from 100s to 1,000,000s of interactions. 'Organized Complexity' denotes a system with a sizable number of factors which are interrelated into an organic whole. Systems with 10s of interactions can be carefully analyzed using the scientific method and, as discussed above, systems with 1,000,000s of interactions can be modeled using probability/statistics. This leaves a middle region whose interactions show the essential feature of 'organization' and are extremely difficult to model. In other words, 'Organized Complexity' systems emit behavior its original parts are incapable of independently (hence the feature of organization). An example of a system of organized complexity could be a company, with its employees as the system's parts. Computer modeling and simulation has proven to be the most effective tool available to understand organized complexity.

### Chaos Theory  
The study of dynamical systems whose apparently random states of disorder and irregularities are governed by underlying patterns and deterministic laws which are extremely sensitive to initial conditions. Edward Lorenz summarized the difficulty of understanding complex systems with the following statement "Chaos: When the present determines the future, but the approximate present does not approximately determine the future". Chaos is bound by the following requirements 1) Must be sensitive to initial conditions, 2) Must be topologically transitive, 3) Must have dense periodic orbits.
